my powershell scripts


1. Powershell script to backup all files of specific file extensions in a origin directory and its subdirectories to a destination directory.
   The script uses file size and md5 to copy only distinct copies of the file to the destination.
   The specific file extensions that are copied are read from a external textfile.
   A log file of each file extension is created and a general log containg all logs  is created as well.
